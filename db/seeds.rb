Chip got his bachelors degree in psychology because he is fascinated by inter- / intrapersonal dynamics.<br><br></div><h1>TL;DR:</h1><div>Chip has lots of diverse teamwork experiences, mostly outside of software development. Chip has been responsible for forming and coordinating teams in a myriad of situations, of various sizes, and for a range of purposes and timeframes.<br><br>Chip much prefers working as part of a team and he believes in being very intentional towards the health and development of the team itself.<br><br></div><h1>The team is always the primary factor</h1><div>Chip believes that the health and strength of the team is usually the main cause of success (or failure). And, while it's natural to assume that the team leader or supervisor is solely responsible for team formation and development, Chip believes that each member of the team is responsible for helping the team develop strong relational bonds. <br><br>Chip has worked on traditional employee / employer teams, served on committees, supervised and led teams, and been responsible for team formation and development.<br><br><strong>Teams facing urgency</strong><br>Chip had the unique experience of managing teams during responses to large-scale disasters.<br>At the American Red Cross, Chip would often have to form teams of mostly volunteers from across the country who had usually never met before. These teams had to be able to function successfully and immediately in order to assist those impacted by the disaster.<br><br>Chip learned to quickly help team members assess their competencies, strengths and needs for the assignment of roles and responsibilities. The whole team needed to be oriented to the goals and Chip learned to ensure that every team member was invested in the success of the team.<br><br>Chip also got his introduction to software because of Grand Rapids Give Camp (Software for Good). He got to work with newly-formed, short-term, long-hours teams of developers and designers.<br><br><strong>Teams under stress<br></strong>During his time working for Pine Rest, Chip experienced being on teams that regularly faced trauma and had to cope with high levels of stress. Chip saw how some teams grew strong because the team members formed, and then were able to rely upon, relational bonds to support each other. This is also where Chip learned that each member of a team has the responsibility of intentionally being honest and supportive of every team member.<br><br><strong>Teams exist for a goal</strong><br>As the majority of his career has been in the nonprofit sector, Chip has been on teams with both volunteers and paid staff. There are often assumptions that volunteers aren't as qualified as paid staff, and that paid staff aren't as committed as volunteers. But Chip  discovered that not only are those assumptions false, they have very little bearing on the success of the team. What mattered more was an individual and collective understanding of the purpose of the team. Teams that know why they were formed and what they need to accomplish are always more likely to be healthy, strong and successful.<br><br><strong>Teams must adapt</strong><br>We live in a society that loves to divine the perfect hierarchy, system, or strategy for team formation and management. I'm guessing you have a few strategies already coming to mind: Agile, Waterfall, XP...<br><br>The more humanistic perspective (some might even say the \"mutually human\" perspective, ah?) recognizes that people are:</div><ul><li>Unique</li><li>Adaptable</li><li>Flexible</li></ul><div><br>And, to add another layer of complexity, everyone has varying degrees of adaptability and flexibility.<br>Teams must be malleable concepts, structured in ways that balance the business purposes and goals with the humans that make up the team. And teams need to change over time. Even if the team is still composed of the same people, people change, grow, adapt, experience crises, etc.</div>", :question_id=>6, :accepted=>true, :views=>0, :votes=>1, :rank=>3, :published_at=>"2022-10-31 04:11:11 UTC"},

When writing SQL queries is the best part, something is wrong.<br><br>Then, in 2011, one of Chip's colleagues heard about the first-ever Grand Rapids GiveCamp event and asked if Chip had any project ideas. That first weekend-long coding session was a life-changer for Chip. Not only was the Mutually Human team really fun to be around, but they actually let Chip help by doing QA testing. A few members of the team, especially Mark Van Holstyn, encouraged Chip that he could learn Ruby on Rails and pointed him to a lot of great resources.<br><br>From then on, Chip has been coding in the evenings and on weekends, stumbling through new concepts and technologies, getting really good at Rails and not too bad at Ruby.<br><br>When Chip is feeling the perfect mix of cocky and inspired, he dives into StackOverflow and does his best to answer every newly posted Ruby-related question.

  {:id=>13, :title=>nil, :title_slug=>"", :body=>"<div>Chip was born into the programming world in the golden era of TDD and thus was presented with write-the-test-first design patterns in many tutorials and guides. A practice which chafed at him from early on.<br><br>Chip's main production app, <a href=\"https://make.20liters.org/\">filterbuildscheduler</a>, has nearly complete system, model and job tests. At time of writing: 1,073 passing tests.<br><br>On the other end of the spectrum, Chip only has 462 tests in his other production app: <a href=\"https://track.20liters.org/\">liters_tracker</a>. While the codebase is smaller, the test coverage is also smaller. The main part of the application is a forward-facing stats and story viewer. That part of the app has robust testing coverage. The back-end, data entry and reporting side that is only really touched by 3 people occasionally is lacking in some coverage.<br><br>Instead of writing tests before implementing code, Chip has found it much more comfortable and natural to inject a final review-everything-and-write-tests step into his development-deployment cycle. He has found that performing a final inspection that includes writing tests, cleaning up, fine tuning, and refactoring <em>always </em>leads him to discovering some hidden mistakes, conflicting ideas, unused methods, slow code, etc.<br><br>Chip focuses on writing model method tests, system tests, and tests for jobs or services. He rarely writes view and controller tests. Overall, he believes your testing practices (or even having tests at all) must prove themselves to add practical value in the quality of the process and end result, otherwise, why bother?<br><br></div><div><strong>It's worth noting: </strong>Chip recognizes that owning the entire code base as a solo dev lends itself to various flexibilities that teams working together might not enjoy. First and foremost, <em>Chip is a team player and will set aside his own testing philosophies to adopt the standards and preferences of the team and company.</em></div><div><br>If your interest is piqued, read on for a more nuanced delve into Chip's thinking on this matter.<br>======================================================================<br><br>While TDD seems to Chip like a good moral practice, akin to 6-month dental checks, it often ran afoul of how he approaches software development.<br>The practical use case for TDD is a piece of straight-forward, encapsulated code. When you know exactly what you are about to do, writing a test for it first is very achievable. <br><br></div><pre>I need a new method: Post#has_answers? \r\n1. Write a test:\r\n  A. When a Post is not a question, it should return false\r\n  B. When a Post is a question,\r\n    1. And it has one or more associated answers, it should return true\r\n2. Write the method\r\n3. Ensure the test passes</pre><div><br>But most of the time, Chip starts with a broader scope: \"I want to retrieve, store, occasionally update and present my StackOverflow reputation and badges on this site.\"<br>When starting on this feature, there are a few paths Chip could take and he usually likes to start down one of those paths and see what he finds:<br><br></div><pre>1. Retrieve reputation and badge info from SO profile\r\n  A. Does SO have an open API?\r\n  B. Does SO offer a JSON representation of a profile?\r\n  C. If not A or B, we might have to get and parse the HTML of the SO profile</pre><div>Starting with a specific test at this point is impossible. After doing some research, <a href=\"https://github.com/chiperific/chipoverflow/blob/main/app/jobs/update_reputation_job.rb\">C was the answer</a>.<br><br>We're still not to the level of specificity required of a good test. So Chip starts toying with ideas and trying some strategies. He eventually settles on using Net::HTTP and  Nokogiri in an ApplicationJob, but once he gets into the flow of tinkering and building, he rarely stops moving forward to go write failing tests first.<br><br>Which leads us to Chip's preferences (from his upcoming memoir):</div><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.codewithjason.com/examples-pointless-rspec-tests/\">Don't test what Rails (or Ruby or a gem) does for us</a>.</li><li>Test behaviors, not implementation</li><li>Write tests for what I struggled to get working in the first place</li><li>Write most tests when I think the app is ready for first deployment</li><li>Write tests for everything I add after the app is deployed</li></ol><div><br></div><div>Hometown sweetheart <a href=\"https://www.codewithjason.com/\">Jason Swett</a> uses car repair analogies in lots of his articles on Rails testing, so let me follow suite. <br><br></div><div><strong>Once a car rolls off the assembly line, when the company thinks it's complete, but before it goes to the consumer, it goes through a vigorous safety and function test.</strong></div><div><br>Chip finds himself naturally following these general phases for app development:<br><br></div><ol><li>During scaffolding phases: some model tests, checking for constraints Chip added</li><li>During build-out phases: hardly ever, Chip is trying various strategies and tinkering</li><li>During detailed tuning and completion of specific features: write tests for features that feel duct taped together or in need of tuning or refactoring to make sure they meet the objective, a minimum </li><li>During final sprints: nope, just get the code into the files</li><li>Before initial production deploy: yes, in fact, it's worth adding a whole new step: 6.</li><li><em>App review</em>: Go through every model and test every method.

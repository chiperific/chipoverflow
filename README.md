# Hello, Interviewers!
Easter eggs are fun, but is this really the time and place?

`## =====> Hello, Interviewers!`

I added a specific comment to anything I wanted to point out in my public repos.

I'm assuming you like to pay some attention to details, but don't want to read every file, so I added this breadcrumb trail for you.

# TODO
1. Header has TODO links
  - Something creative with inbox
  - Generalized searchbar

2. Script to get:
  - reputation
  - gold badges
  - silver badges
  - bronze badges

3. Breadcrumb md page with links to all repos

"//a[@href='/users/1880203/chiperific']"
pg.at_xpath("//a[@href='/users/1880203/chiperific']//div[2]")
